## Hi there 👋 I'm a backend developer passionate about automation, cloud technologies, and clean development workflows.


- 🔭 I’m currently working on a **server for a blind typing simulator**, using **REST APIs** and **WebSocket** technologies.  
  I’m also setting up **Docker images**, **docker-compose**, and **GitLab CI/CD pipelines** to automate the development process.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning **cloud development** and building my own tools to automate **CI/CD workflows**.  
  I’m also preparing for future **job opportunities**.

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any **cloud-related projects**.
